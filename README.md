Super Star Trek - Malware Hacking using Ghidra and Binary Translation

Super Star Trek is a procedurally generated game, which means that the game will randomly create a "playing field" for the game along with a good amount of random events. The game has quite a few "easter eggs" hidden in it, and I would suggest playing the game for a while to see if you can uncover them. Don't ignore the manual either as it will give you a rundown on how to play the game.

Super Star Trek has undergone many iterations over the years, and yours truly first experienced this fine strategy game back on an old Apple II computer in school.

My version is different than the one listed above on the Internet Archive. Aside from being the "Super" version found on mainframe computer systems of the day, I have made a few alterations of my own. For instance...

The crew has inadvertantely created a sentient AI and it has taken over the Enterprise! While it will allow you to play the game and attempt to defeat the Klingons, you must bypass the self-destruct password before game's end otherwise the AI will fly the Enterprise to Earth and use it as a weapon to destroy the Federation!

The game has also been set to the most difficult mode, Emeritus. Good luck with that... (even the game will say that...and that's not my doing) and I've made a few other alterations to the codebase which make my code unique (and not something you can Google and find quick answers to).

Requirements

Discover the password which the computer set for the self-destruct process
Locate where the password check resides in the program
Bypass the password check within the binary so the computer can't change it again on you!
Add your name in the credits along with mine
Everything above resides in the one binary file, sst. The additional file, sst.txt is a README file for the game, and it also serves as in-game documentation (It was a neat idea for 1974, actually).
